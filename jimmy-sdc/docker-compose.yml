# version: "3.9" (supposedly optional)

services:
# first start db
# then start server
# indicate that server depends on db
# i guess you create/specify volumes here too?

  web:
    build: .
    # or do I need to refer to the Dockerfile in the server folder?
    ports:
      # - "3000:3000"
      - "80:3000"
      #I believe this needs to connect 80 to 3000 if I want to deploy on an EC2

  mongo:
    image: mongo
    ports:
      - 27017:27017
    volumes:
      - sdc:/data/db
      # named volume config goes here

volumes:
  sdc
  # named volume config goes here too
  # I've seen sdc, sdc:, and sdc:{}, not sure which one is correct
